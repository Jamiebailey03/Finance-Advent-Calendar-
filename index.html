                    <p class="text-lg text-yellow-200 mb-4">Remember when GRNI, Intake, and Stock Suite reporting felt like it would never end? We were spending around <strong>10 hours every single week</strong> wrestling with static data, layering manipulation upon manipulation, just to get something the business could actually understand. It was manual, it was tedious, and – let's be honest – it was a minefield for human error.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-yellow-200 mb-4">Today we're tackling not one, but two finance processes that were crying out for an upgrade: FX Proposals and HSBC Receivables Finance. Let's dig in.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Problem 1: FX Proposals – The Macro Bottleneck 🚫</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The old way? A macro sitting on the X-drive that only one person could run at a time. Want to run multiple reports simultaneously? Tough luck – you'd have to queue up like it's the only coffee machine in the office.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Fix:</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Moving FX Proposals into the Finance Gateway via AI automation has completely changed the game. Now multiple team members can run different reports at the same time. The process is fully automated, so manual errors have been eliminated. And the output? Beautifully clean and easy to review.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">Main win: Ease of Use ✅</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Problem 2: HSBC Receivables Finance – The Excel Nightmare 😱</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Previously, this one was painful. Four separate debtors' ledgers needed comparing week-on-week, tracking new invoices, credit notes, and cleared items. The method? One ledger at a time, in Excel, with formula after formula after formula. One slip-up in a formula, and your whole analysis is compromised.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Fix:</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Our AI app now handles all four ledgers automatically. The user simply uploads the prior week and current week debtors for each ledger – the app does the rest. New invoices, credit notes, cleared items – all identified and presented clearly. No manual formulas. No room for error.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Main Win: Zero Risk of Manual Error ✅</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">What We've Gained</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Between these two process improvements, we've freed up hours of time every single week. But more importantly, we've eliminated bottlenecks (goodbye, queue for macros), removed access friction, and taken human error completely out of the equation. That's the kind of upgrade that makes everyone's week easier.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Takeaway</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">When repetitive, formula-heavy work can be automated, it should be. Your team will thank you. 🤝</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Meet Joey – building AI-powered solutions to two of our biggest operational headaches. One person. Two incredible wins. Let's dive in.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Problem 1: Deliverables Chaos 📋</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Leading a team means juggling deliverables across multiple streams, each with different due dates and interconnected tasks. Spreadsheets multiply. Emails get lost. Suddenly you're spending half your week just tracking what needs doing when – instead of actually getting it done.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Joey's Solution: The Deliverables Dashboard</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Joey built a dashboard that keeps tabs on every deliverable, due date, and associated task in one place. Need to pull a report for stakeholders? One click. Want a status update for your leadership team? The dashboard generates it instantly. Want to share the magic with the wider org? Done.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Win: Your team spends time doing, not tracking. ✅</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Problem 2: Payment Reconciliation – The Never-Ending Nightmare 😫</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Welcome to THG's world: multiple websites, multiple currencies, multiple payment providers. All selling goods. All sending money in different ways. And somewhere in the middle, someone has to reconcile it all – manually, laboriously, and with a spreadsheet that would make anyone weep.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">It's a monumental task. It's tedious. It's error-prone.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Joey's Solution: The Reconciliation Tool 🚀</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Joey built a reconciliation tool that matches payment provider data against bank data with ease and full traceability. No more manual matching. No more wondering where the discrepancies are. The tool handles the complexity; you get clarity.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Numbers:</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Entering UAT:</strong> December (that's now)</li>
                        <li><strong>Live:</strong> Early January</li>
                        <li><strong>Time saved:</strong> Hundreds of hours per month for the reconciliations team</li>
                        <li><strong>Money saved:</strong> Thousands of £££ for THG</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Real Win: Faster reconciliation means faster cash certainty, fewer errors, and a team that can focus on analysis instead of data entry.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Takeaway</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Joey is proof that one person with vision and technical skill can build solutions that transform how we work. When you automate the tedious stuff – whether it's tracking deliverables or reconciling payments across multiple currencies and providers – your teams get their time back. And that time? That's where the real value lives.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Big shout out to Joey for making this happen. A genuinely merry Christmas. 🎅✨</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">In SSC Nutrition, we didn't just pick one lane. We looked at the whole highway. This year, we moved from "how we've always done it" to "how it should be done," utilising three different AI platforms to tackle AR & AP.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Project 1: AR Deductions – Decoding the Chaos 🧩</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Deductions management is notoriously complex. The requirements are often hidden in people's heads rather than documented processes.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Fix:</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Using Replit, we built an intricate Proof of Concept (POC) that maps the entire deductions lifecycle. This wasn't just about automation; it was an investigative tool. The build exposed the true end-to-end requirements of the process, highlighting gaps we didn't know existed. We now have a blueprint for a tool that actually works in the real world.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Enter Google AI Studio. We created a tool that reads the invoice content, understands the context, and automatically drafts the perfect email ready for the customer. No more manual data entry, no more copy-paste fatigue.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">We deployed a Microsoft PowerAutomate POC that acts as a gatekeeper. It instantly recognises if an invoice has a valid PO and checks if the format is correct before it enters the workflow. If it's wrong, it's rejected automatically.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-yellow-200 mb-4"><strong>PLC Audit Deadlines Wait For No One – So We Built a Tool That Doesn't Either</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">As a PLC, hitting group audit deadlines isn't a nice-to-have. It's a must-have. Late submissions mean financial penalties and reputational damage we simply cannot afford. One slip-up cascades across the entire business.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The challenge? Managing the complexity. Here's where it gets real.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Problem: Raw Data Chaos 😤</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The EY audit portal is our single source of truth – it shows every active audit request on any given day. But here's the catch: the data comes out completely unformatted and virtually unreadable.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">During peak PLC reporting season, the Group Reporting team needs to send out outstanding lists daily. Every request needs routing to the right person, fast. But before any of that could happen, someone had to:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                        <li>Copy the raw portal data</li>
                        <li>Clean it</li>
                        <li>Reformat it</li>
                        <li>Check it</li>
                        <li>Then send something meaningful to the teams</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">It was painful. It was manual. It was eating up time we didn't have.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">We built a custom AI application that takes all of that manual work and bins it.</p>

                        <li>Get a clear visual dashboard showing every outstanding request by owner, priority, and status</li>

                        <li>Share straight with the teams responsible</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">No copying. No cleaning. No reformatting. No checking. Just clarity.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">What Changed</h3>
                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Before:</strong> Hours of manual work before you could even send the outstanding list.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>After:</strong> Seconds to a polished, visual dashboard that everyone can instantly understand.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Real Win: Teams spot critical items immediately. Owners know exactly what they need to prioritize. The audit keeps moving. We stay ahead of deadlines.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">We didn't stop at UK audits. We've rolled this out to our overseas audits too – further enhancing our reporting and keeping the entire group aligned and on track.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Takeaway</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">When your deadlines are non-negotiable, your processes have to be bulletproof. Automation isn't a nice extra – it's how you protect what matters most. One tool. One workflow. Complete peace of mind.</p>

Here's the thing: funding and GP accuracy have never been stronger, and that's meant the trade teams could make decisions as things were happening with genuine confidence in the numbers. That's not just efficiency; that's competitive advantage.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Retail Beauty's promotional activity with brands is relentless – and brilliant for business. The downside? Around 600 invoices a month in normal periods, rocketing to close to 1,500 during peak months. Every. Single. One. Was being sent manually.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Working closely with the change request team, we rolled out an automated solution in September. Here's the magic: the moment an invoice posts to the ledger, it automatically sends to the customer the following morning. No manual intervention. No delays. No bottlenecks.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Instead of spending hours sending invoices one by one, the team has freed up significant time to do work that actually drives value.

                    <p class="mb-4">One of the key accounting judgements we make as a business is the valuation of outstanding customer account credits at month-end. This valuation requires processing large volumes of data at an individual customer level, assessing each credit based on expected redemption rates and the anticipated cost of delivering additional products to the customer.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">These credits include customer service account credits, marketing referral credits, and, more recently, loyalty-based account credits.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Problem: Spreadsheet Spaghetti 😤</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Historically, this process was managed through complex spreadsheets that combined multiple data sources and reconciliations back to the trial balance. Due to the number of inputs involved, this approach was prone to errors, which could lead to volatility in the P&L.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">It also required significant manual review each month to correct and understand the data. Every month-end meant hours of checking, cross-referencing, and hoping nothing slipped through the cracks.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Solution: AI Takes the Wheel 🚀</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">To address these challenges, this became one of the first areas where we applied AI development. We began by reviewing and updating existing process flows to ensure they were fit for purpose.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">What used to take hours now happens automatically. The team can focus on analysis and decision-making rather than data wrestling.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The month-end valuation process is now robust, reliable, and repeatable. Teams can trust the numbers, every single time.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">A number of Beauty Brands have onboarded this year on a concession model. This means we need to ensure we're reporting all transactions to the brands consistently and accurately so that they can recognise the revenue from ourselves.</p>

Any late changes meant double updates, extra checks, and plenty of room for human error - not exactly the dream when you're up against reporting deadlines.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Solution: Build Once, Use Forever 🚀</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">With help from our AI tools, we re-evaluated the process. The recommendation was simple but game-changing: build the full financial statements directly in Excel and generate the final PDF from there. No more duplicating work, no more mismatched figures, and no more last-minute scrambles updating two places at once.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">By using AI and well-structured prompts, we redesigned our Excel templates, so they're formatted for direct conversion to a Companies House-ready PDF.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Result: A smoother process, fewer errors and meaningful time saved. ✅</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">Problem 2: The Validation Mountain 📚</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">As a global business, we prepare statutory accounts for a large number of subsidiaries - up to 80 legal entities each year. Producing the accounts is time-intensive on its own, but the real challenge used to be the validation stage: checking every single set of accounts to make sure numbers tie, references match, and there are no rounding or consistency errors.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">On top of that, we also prepare the Annual Report and Accounts which runs to almost 300 pages. Ensuring every number in the notes aligns perfectly with the primary statements used to mean someone manually flicking through page after page, recalculating totals and cross-checking every reference. It was accurate, but far from efficient.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">The Solution: AI-Powered Accuracy Checks 🤖</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Using Google Agentspace, this guided us to develop a very detailed, AI-friendly prompt we can use each time that completely changes this step.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Here's how it works:</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                        <li>Upload the document — whether it's an individual set of accounts or the full ARA</li>
                        <li>The AI automatically scans it for issues</li>
                        <li>It flags anything that doesn't add up, from balance sheet mismatches to note disclosures that don't align</li>
                        <li>Within seconds, it generates a clear, structured report showing what's wrong and where amendments are needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-6">The Win: Huge amounts of manual review time saved and greatly reduced risk of errors slipping through. ✅</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Real Impact</h3>
                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Before:</strong> Two documents, double work, manual validation of 80 entities plus a 300-page ARA</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>After:</strong> Single source, automated validation, seconds instead of hours</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Takeaway</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">When you're dealing with statutory reporting deadlines, efficiency isn't optional – it's essential. By automating the tedious and error-prone parts, we've transformed how we deliver accurate, compliant reporting. That's AI working for us, not against us. 🎁</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Challenge: IFRS 16 Complexity 📋</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">From the financial year ending 2019, THG adopted the IFRS 16 Leases accounting standard, representing one of the most significant presentational changes to the Group's reported figures. IFRS 16 fundamentally alters lease accounting by requiring lessees to recognise most leases on the balance sheet.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">This enhances transparency and comparability across businesses but introduces additional complexity in measurement and reporting. It remains a key area of focus for THG's auditors, who regularly challenge the accuracy of lease valuations.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Problem: Expensive External Dependency 😤</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Over the years, THG has invested substantial resources and system enhancements to manage this requirement, currently relying on Tagetik to process data and perform calculations—at considerable cost to the Group.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">However, the existing process is not user-friendly and frequently necessitates external consultancy support for system changes and issue resolution. Every change, every fix, every question meant more external spend and more delays.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-3">The Solution: Built In-House, Built to Last 🚀</h3>

                    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-300 mb-2">✅ Regained Control</p>
